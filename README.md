## Usage

Note: as of now, this is not very user friendly. See the  [original repo](https://github.com/Xmader/musescore-downloader) by @Xmader if you want more options, but note that the quality of the downloaded PDF is fairly bad.

1. Navigate to the muse score page with the sheet you like
2. Run the script `dist/main.js` from the developer tools in the browser
3. Select the download option you like from newly appeared buttons
